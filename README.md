# How-the-NBA-has-Changed
The NBA has changed every year, and that change is rapidly progressing faster than we may realize. I look to visualize this in order to get a better understanding of how it's changing and to also demonstrate the rate of change as well.

Twenty years ago in 2002, George Bush was President, Salt Lake City hosted the Olympics, BlueSky Studios first released movie, Ice Age was released, Kelly Clarkson won the 1st American Idol, and most importantly the NBA was drastically different than what it is today. It's no secret the NBA has changed over the last 2 decades.  How the NBA has changed is a common talking point amongst the media.

How the NBA has changed doesn't go beyond more than just that in the media. It's an easy thing to throw out and say from the Ex-NBA oldheads, but in reality, the reason for the change was to protect the longevity of players. I'm sure prime Shaq would have loved the option of having a rest day here and there even if he might not admit that now. There are so many other ways the NBA has changed over the last couple of decades that are far more interesting than the bar talk from your 60-year-old uncle saying the NBA players are soft now. We take a deep dive and analyze how the NBA has changed over the last couple of decades.

1. Fouls 

The first and maybe the most interesting way that the NBA has changed is how often the whistle is blown. I, amongst many others, have complained about how often fouls are called in the NBA. It feels like every other play there is some type of foul called. As someone who didn't follow the NBA until the 2014 season, I didn't see for myself how the NBA was called in the 90s and 2000s. But from a lot of the media personalities who have been watching or even playing in the 90s and 2000s you would think that the NBA then was foul-less game. Where you could take someone's legs out on a dunk and not be called for it.

When you look at how the average amount of fouls that are called per game and also the amount of free throws per field goal attempts per game you would more than likely be surpised on how it exactly it has changed.
