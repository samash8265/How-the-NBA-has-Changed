# How-the-NBA-has-Changed
The NBA has changed every year, and that change is rapidly progressing faster than we may realize. I look to visualize this in order to get a better understanding of how it's changing and to also demonstrate the rate of change as well.

Twenty years ago in 2002, George Bush was President, Salt Lake City hosted the Olympics, BlueSky Studios first released movie, Ice Age was released, Kelly Clarkson won the 1st American Idol, and most importantly the NBA was drastically different than what it is today. It's no secret the NBA has changed over the last 2 decades.  How the NBA has changed is a common talking point amongst the media.

How the NBA has changed doesn't go beyond more than just that in the media. It's an easy thing to throw out and say from the Ex-NBA oldheads, but in reality, the reason for the change was to protect the longevity of players. I'm sure prime Shaq would have loved the option of having a rest day here and there even if he might not admit that now. There are so many other ways the NBA has changed over the last couple of decades that are far more interesting than the bar talk from your 60-year-old uncle saying the NBA players are soft now. We take a deep dive and analyze how the NBA has changed over the last couple of decades.

1. Fouls & FT per FGA

The first and maybe the most interesting way that the NBA has changed is how often the whistle is blown. I, amongst many others, have complained about how often fouls are called in the NBA. It feels like every other play there is some type of foul called. As someone who didn't follow the NBA until the 2014 season, I didn't see for myself how the NBA was called in the 90s and 2000s. But from a lot of the media personalities who have been watching or even playing in the 90s and 2000s you would think that the NBA then was foul-less game. Where you could take someone's legs out on a dunk and not be called for it.

When you look at how the average amount of fouls that are called per game and also the amount of free throws per field goal attempts per game you would more than likely be surpised on how it exactly it has changed.

These graphs expose the notion that this era of the NBA was more physical, in fact it shows the opposite, where fouls were called way less frequently today than it was in the 90s and 2000s. Was there more egregious fouls or did phsycial teams like the Bad Boy Pistons exist? Yes. But in general the NBA then could be easily argued as being less physical or superstars got better superstar treatment.

2. Pace

Pace can be defined as an estimate of the amount of possessions per 48 minutes. Pace is possibly the most obvious difference you can see in NBA games now. Even in the past couple years it feels like the pace of the NBA has skyrocketed. Where teams are opting for quick 3s or shots close to the hoop. Teams like the Golden State Warriors brought this style of play to the NBA where the Warriors have won multiple championships using this formula. When other teams mimicked this strategy and found success, more teams began to implement the same strategy around the league. While you can see the increase of pace in the NBA with your own eyes the data also supports that.

As you can see, over the last 2 decades the pace of the NBA has increased dramatically and steadily. You can see an increase of almost 10 possessions per game between the 2002 season and the 2019 season. The last couple years, we have seen a slight decrease from the peak 2019 season. This could be due to teams starting to take possessions more carefully and not wanting to waste a single one. We'll see how this trend continues in the coming 2022 season.

3. Efficiency & Offensive Rebounds

Efficiency is defined as achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense. This definition translates to the NBA towards teams and players as making shots at a high rate. It can quantified using FG% or eFG%. Effective Field Goal percentage (abbreviated eFG%) is a statistic that adjusts field goal percentage to account for the fact that three-point field goals count for three points while field goals only count for two points. I use eFG% to show the change in efficiency as 3-point shooting has become more prevalent in modern day NBA.

Offensive Rebounds and Efficiency go hand-in-hand. This can be simply explained as, if there are more missed shots in a games, then there is more rebounds to go around, which results in more offensive rebounds. You can see how offensive rebounds directly correlate to efficiency over the past decade.

So not only is the pace of the NBA increasing, the efficiency is as well. Which goes to show how talented and well-rounded the NBA is becoming where players and teams are learning how to optimize their shot selection in order to maximize their wins. Offensive Rebounds per game on the other hand has decreased. Which rings true to the simple concept where if more shots are being made there will be less rebounds to go around.

4. 3-Point Shooting

3-Point Shooting is an another apparent change in today's NBA. Records getting broke each year on a personal and organizational level. The top-5 amount of three pointers made in a season by a team happened in the last 4 seasons. The Warriors had an enormous impact on how the league is shaped today. You can see a steady increase in 3-Pointers being attempted (3PA) and made (3PM) through the last 2 decades, in the years after their Championship success you can see bigger jumps in that steady increase of 3PA/3PM.

1.5 3PA increase, .37 3PM
1.7 3PA increase after initial championship, 2 3PA increase and 3 3PA increase following 2016 and 2017 championships. 
.7 3PM, .8 3PM, .9 3PM increases in 2014, 2016, 2017
